# Powerline Light Theme

A Powerline-derived theme for light backgrounds aiming to balance bling and utility. Created by [Imran Chaudhry](https://imranchaudhry.com/) / April 2023.

The colours were set using some experimentation and consulting an xterm 256 colour chart like [this](https://github.com/gawin/bash-colors-256)

This is based on the Powerline theme. Please see also [the documentation of the
powerline theme](../powerline/README.md).
